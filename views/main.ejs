                    <p class="introP">After the sheer disrespect Grumio endured in the Caecilius household-- harsh treatment from Metella, losing his girlfriend to that caudex Clemens, and overall blatant disregard-- Grumio had decided that enough was enough. As many do, he had hit that point of his life where his options were growing scarce. Honestly, he had started considering beating random farmers with clubs for fun. However, the eruption of Vesuvius was enough to push him into a new direction: military.</p>
                    <p class="introP">Of course, heâ€¦lacked much of the skill needed to be a soldier. He was far from preferred age, further still from physical fitness. Though, he did make a splendid peacock. So splendid, in fact, that he was hired as an on-site cook for a particular legionary fort. No one can quite recall what the previous name was. All that is known is that Grumio was just so incredibly amazing that the fort was immediately renamed after him. Because Grumio's just so cool like that, y'know?</p>
